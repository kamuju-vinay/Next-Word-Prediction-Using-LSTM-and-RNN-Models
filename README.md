# Next-Word-Prediction-Using-LSTM-and-RNN-Models
This project implements a next word prediction system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. The aim is to leverage deep learning techniques to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding context, enhancing applications like text completion and chatbots
